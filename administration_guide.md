# Store administration guide

This section covers most important information related to the management of the YellowCube Magento 2 store. This includes products, shipments and stock management.

YellowCube is just a tiny part of the entire process. We suggest store administrators to study the official Magento 2 documentation that covers [product](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/catalog/product-create.html) and [shipments](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/sales/shipments-create.html) management.
