# Store administration guide

This section covers most important information related to the management of the  
WooCommerce store. This includes product and order creation and management.

YellowCube is just a tiny part of the entire process. We suggest store admins  
to study the official WooCommerce documentation that covers [product](https://docs.woocommerce.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/setup-products/) and [order](https://docs.woocommerce.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/managing-orders/) management.
